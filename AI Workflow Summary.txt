AI-Assisted Workflow Summary – ADmyBRAND Project
Tools & Workflow
The ADmyBRAND marketing platform was developed using a highly efficient AI-assisted workflow, combining the strengths of multiple AI tools with focused manual refinements.

AI Tools Used
ChatGPT (GPT-4): For planning, market analysis, prompt engineering, and technical architecture.

Lovable: To rapidly generate frontend UI scaffolding using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Google Gemini: For generating demo videos and promotional image content.

Cursor IDE: For implementing advanced features, animations, and performance tweaks.

Key Prompts & Use Cases
Lovable generated a full responsive React landing page using the prompt: "Create a responsive React landing page with hero section, features, pricing, and testimonials..."

Cursor IDE was used to implement smooth scrolling navigation and add complex Framer Motion animations.

Gemini helped create marketing visuals and demo videos showing the AI-powered workflow.

AI vs Manual Split
AI-Generated (85-90%): UI components, routing, styling, media content, and documentation.

Manual (10-15%): Advanced interactivity, custom hooks, responsive tweaks, and cross-browser fixes.

Outcome
This hybrid workflow reduced development time by 60-70%, delivering a polished, production-ready platform in just 1–2 weeks instead of the typical 3–4 months. The success came from leveraging AI for speed while retaining human control for quality and polish.
